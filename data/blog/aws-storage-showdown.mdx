## Quick Overview: Choose Storage Based on Performance, Access Patterns, and Cost

Choosing the right AWS storage service is crucial for optimizing application performance, scalability, and cost. This guide breaks down Amazon's three primary storage options—EBS, EFS, and S3—organized by performance tiers to help you make informed decisions for your workloads.

- **EBS (Tier 1)** → Single-instance, high-performance workloads such as databases or boot volumes
- **EFS (Tier 2)** → Shared file systems for multi-instance or collaborative applications
- **S3 (Tier 3)** → Internet-scale object storage for web apps, backups, and data lakes

## AWS Storage Performance Hierarchy

AWS storage services can be classified into three performance-based tiers:

| Tier                        | Service                     | Storage Type   | Description                                                                      | Best For                                     |
| :-------------------------- | :-------------------------- | :------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------- |
| **Tier 1 (Fastest)**        | EBS (Elastic Block Store)   | Block Storage  | High-speed volumes attached to EC2 instances. Low latency, high IOPS.            | Databases, boot volumes, HPC                 |
| **Tier 2 (Moderate)**       | EFS (Elastic File System)   | File Storage   | Scalable NFS-based shared storage accessible by multiple EC2 instances.          | Multi-instance apps, collaborative workloads |
| **Tier 3 (Cost-Optimized)** | S3 (Simple Storage Service) | Object Storage | Internet-scale storage accessible via REST API. High durability and scalability. | Web apps, backups, data lakes                |

| :------------- | :------------------------------ | :--------------------- |
| S3 (Tier 3)    | $0.023                          | ✅ Most Cost-Effective |
| EBS (Tier 1)   | $0.08                           | ⚠️ Moderate Cost       |
| EFS (Tier 2)   | $0.30                           | ❌ Highest Cost        |

_Insight:_ Cost scales with performance. Choose **EBS** for speed, **EFS** for shared access, and **S3** for scale and cost-efficiency. Consider hidden costs like S3 requests, EFS throughput scaling, or EBS snapshot storage.

## Key Takeaways

- **Performance Hierarchy:** EBS > EFS > S3
- **Access Patterns Drive Choice:**
  - Single-instance high-performance → EBS
  - Multi-instance shared → EFS
  - Internet-scale → S3
- **Cost vs Performance Trade-off:** Higher performance comes at a higher cost
- **Scalability:** EBS requires manual management; EFS and S3 scale automatically
- **Decision Framework:** Match storage tier to application needs for optimal performance, cost, and accessibility
